# Introduction #
The Salesforce Data Loader Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for automating business processes, and integrating Salesforce with other systems.  However, configuring the CLI is daunting, especially for first-time users.  CLI quickstart (CLIq) is the solution!

# Important #
There is an issue with Data Loader 24.0 on Windows with CLIq 2.1.1.

2.2.0 should resolve those problems.

## Overview ##
**CLIq provides a _simple wizard_ to create directory structures and configuration files for the Salesforce Data Loader Command Line Interface.**  You can spend hours configuring the CLI manually, or use CLIq and you will have a working configuration in less than **5 minutes**.
After creating a CLIq configuration, you can reference the Data Loader documentation and make adjustments as needed.

  * **Quickly configure scheduled exports/updates for your Salesforce Org**
  * Text and graphical interface
  * Handles all the tricky stuff:
    * Creates a process-conf.xml
    * Validates your username/password, queries, and entity names (avoids case-sensitivity issues)
    * Encrypts password
    * Creates an organized directory structure
    * Creates a bat file which can be scheduled on Windows using Windows Scheduler
    * Creates a sh script which can be scheduled on UNIX using cron
  * Written in Java - Tested on Windows and Mac OS X (UNIX)!

## What CLIq Doesn't Do (Yet) ##
  * Write SOQL statements (for Exports) - You'll need to know how to write SOQL.
  * Configure Data Loader to write directly to Databases
  * Automatically configure SDL file.
